# Introduction
## oAuth2
See [FrontierDevelopments-oAuth2-notes](FrontierDevelopments-oAuth2-notes.md)
for how to use Frontier Developments' oAuth2 system for Authorization on
the CAPI.

In all instances you'll need to use the Access Token obtained via
oAuth2 by setting an HTTP header for the request:

        Authorization: Bearer <access_token>

Note that in theory the token type could be different from 'Bearer'.
It's safest to store the token_type that comes back from the request for
an Access Token and repeat that back in this header.

---
You might occasionally see a header:

		Set-Cookie: access_token=1566841911%7C%7C<40 character hex string>; domain=companion.orerve.net; path=/; expires=Mon, 26-Aug-2019 17:51:51 UTC; secure
in the responses from the CAPI end points.  This seems to serve no
purpose, and is perhaps left over from the work to implement oAuth2 on
the service.

1. The start of the access_token value appears to be a Unix
Epoch timestamp, 86400 seconds in the past.  That matches the
expiry time on the cookie.
2. That "40 character hex string" doesn't seem to be a valid
JSON Web Token, for instance, or otherwise related to either
the Refresh or Access Tokens.

# Limit the frequency of queries

The CAPI is not designed as a real-time service to be spammed with
queries in an attempt to always be up to date.  For one thing the CAPI's
data itself can lag behind what the relevant game client is seeing.

In general try not to issue more than one query a minute.  Although
EDMarketConnector gets away with issuing all of `/profile`, `/market`,
and `/shipyard` in rapid succession upon docking, Frontier have in the
past stated that rate limiting might kick in if you perform more than 2
queries per second.

For the `/journal` endpoint you should **not** expect it to update in
realtime from live gameplay.  Ideally you should only query it once a
gameplay session is complete.

# Available CAPI hosts
You need to use the correct host for the data you are expecting to
retrieve.  As of Odyssey Update 14 this mostly pertains to the
Live/Legacy galaxy split.

The rest of this documentation will assume the Live galaxy and use its
host.

## Live CAPI host
The main CAPI host is `companion.orerve.net`. **Since Odyssey
Update 14 this only returns data for the Live galaxy.**

## Legacy CAPI host
To retrieve data pertaining to the Legacy galaxy you must use the
alternate host `legacy-companion.orerve.net`.

## CAPI for any beta of the game
In the past Frontier has sometimes provided a beta-specific CAPI host.
When it was available (this was before Odyssey Update 14 and the galaxy
split) the hostname was `pts-companion.orerve.net`.

---
# End Points

You can check the currently available endpoints by sending a bare query
to the CAPI host, i.e. `/` path component as in <https://companion.orerve.net/>.

This will produce output like:

## HTTP Status Codes

1. 401 - Unauthorized - Since the 'September Update' patch on 2019-09-17
   the CAPI servers use this HTTP status code to signal that the
   provided Access Token is invalid (certainly for when it's expired).

   The body containing:

		{"status":401,"message":"JWT has incorrect\/unexpected fields"}
1. 418 - "I'm a teapot" - used to signal that the service is down for
   maintenance.  Technically Frontier shouldn't be using this as it's a
   joke from a couple of April Fools' RFCs:
   <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2324>
   <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7168>

1. 422 - "Unprocessable Entity" - previously used to signal that a provided
   Access Token was invalid, likely due to it being expired.  This changed with
   the 'September Update' patch in 2019.
